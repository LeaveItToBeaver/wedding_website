# Overview

This is a simple React.JS application made for my upcoming wedding on April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023. :)

## What I Learned From This Project.

I learned about better state management more than anything. Even with a simple website like this,
the accumulated overhead for not properly unmounting components can be devistating. 

I learned more about database management with Firebase and the security that goes into that.

Better graphic design techniques.
