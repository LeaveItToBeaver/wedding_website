# Project Overview

This project is a React.js-based web application developed for my wedding on April 1st, 2023. The application was designed to serve as a digital invitation and information hub for guests, featuring details about the event, venue, and schedule.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the development of this wedding website, I gained significant insights and enhanced my skills in several key areas:

- **State Management**: The project underscored the importance of efficient state management within React applications. I encountered firsthand the challenges of managing component lifecycles and learned strategies to mitigate overhead caused by components not being properly unmounted. This experience deepened my understanding of React's lifecycle methods and state management practices, ensuring smoother and more efficient application performance.

- **Database Management and Security with Firebase**: Implementing Firebase as the backend solution offered practical experience in setting up and managing a NoSQL database. I explored Firebase's security rules and authentication features, learning to secure user data effectively and ensure robust access control.

- **Graphic Design and UI/UX Principles**: The project also provided an opportunity to refine my graphic design skills. I focused on creating an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface, applying principles of design and user experience to engage users effectively. This process involved iterative design improvements based on feedback, enhancing my ability to translate visual concepts into functional application components.

## Project Reflections

Balancing the development of this project with a full-time job posed its challenges, leading to some compromises in the final product. Despite not achieving every aspect of my original vision, I am proud of the result and the personal and professional growth I experienced through its completion. The project served not only as a creative outlet for celebrating a significant personal milestone but also as a valuable learning experience in web application development.
