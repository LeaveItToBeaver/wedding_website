# Overview

This is a simple React.JS application made for my wedding on April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023. :)

## What I Learned From This Project.

I learned about better state management more than anything. Even with a simple website like this,
the accumulated overhead for not properly unmounting components can be devistating. 

I learned more about database management with Firebase and the security that goes into that.

Better graphic design techniques.

## Some notes

I created this while I was working a full time job. It didn't turn out entirely how I wanted it to but I am still happy with it. 
If anyone wants to check it out, I will provide the link below. Now that the wedding is over I don't mind showing it on my GitHub.
